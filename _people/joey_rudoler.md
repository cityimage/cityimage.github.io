## About Me
I'm a master's student in Data Science, doing my independent study and thesis with Dr. Kording. I also work full-time as a programmer for Dr. Michael Kahana and Penn's Computational Memory Lab.

## My interests
Broadly interested in data, machine learning, and brains. I've done a lot of work with EEG and human memory in the past. Right now I'm excited about:
* Decoding brain activity using machine learning + applying to closed-loop algorithms
* Transfer learning / domain adaptation
* Open science initiatives, esp. tools for data standardization and sharing.

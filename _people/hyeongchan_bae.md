[Hyeongchan Bae] aims to serve as a bridge connecting researchers in the fields of economics and computer science. He believes that many concepts that social scientists have represented using abstract notions like "intuition" will eventually be expressed and depicted through real-world data.

He also has a profound interest in our daily lives. He has operated a [mentoring organization](https://together.kakao.com/teams/2148) for high school students, worked in a [mental rehabilitation facility](http://www.gounnuri.net/g5/) for schizophrenia patients' social reintegration, and interned as an [economic researcher](https://www.kiet.re.kr/) analyzing macroeconomic trends.

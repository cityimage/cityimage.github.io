### About us
We are a group of data scientists with a keen interest in urban dynamics research. Our lab's focus is diverse and constantly evolving. Currently, our research primarily revolves around the applications of deep learning and neural data analysis in understanding urban phenomena. Additionally, we are actively exploring the intersection of causality and machine learning in urban contexts.

### Research
At our lab, we tackle the fundamental challenge of making sense of urban data. We develop algorithms to analyze and extract insights from various urban datasets. To gain a deeper understanding of information processing in urban systems, we employ computational and neural modeling techniques in conjunction with theoretical frameworks. Our research involves collaborations with electrophysiologists and participation in psychophysical experiments. Furthermore, we actively contribute to the development and utilization of new technologies aimed at collecting urban data.

Our conceptual work addresses information processing in urban systems from two perspectives: (1) By analyzing and interpreting electrophysiological data, we study the behavior of individual urban components, such as neighborhoods or transportation networks. (2) By analyzing and explaining human behavior in urban environments, we investigate the collective dynamics of urban systems. Our approach often adopts a normative or causal viewpoint, aiming to understand the problems that urban systems strive to solve. Bayesian decision theory serves as a systematic framework for quantifying how urban systems make decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Additionally, we explore the potential of causal inference from observational data as a crucial tool for advancing urban science.

Our research projects encompass a wide range of topics, including the study of handshake greetings, human movement patterns, cell-phone-related Parkinson's research, participation in Kaggle competitions, meta-science analysis, data sharing initiatives, and comprehensive neural recordings in mouse models.

To gain a better understanding of the ongoing research in our lab, we encourage you to explore the work of individual lab members. Visit our people page for detailed information about each researcher, including their publications, contact information, and photos.

### Lab Culture
Our lab fosters a vibrant and interdisciplinary culture. We bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds, including statistics, physics, biology, applied mathematics, molecular biology, metascience, and cognitive science. Instead of a single overarching lab project, each researcher is the lead of their individual projects, encouraging curiosity, rapid idea exploration, and continuous learning.

Given the interdisciplinary nature of our lab, we do not have large-scale lab meetings involving all members. Instead, we employ various practices to facilitate effective communication within the lab. These practices include:

Weekly 'lab teachings' sessions, where one member teaches a specific topic or technique.
'One-on-ones' meetings, held every semester, where all lab members spend an hour discussing their work with each other.
Lab tea time, a short 10-minute talk by a lab member on any topic, including their ongoing research.
Coding overviews, structured similarly to the 'one-on-ones' meetings but focused on coding practices and techniques.
The lab provides a hammock, hangboard, and artwork on loan from the Penn Museum, creating a conducive and inspiring environment.
Monday morning donuts at 9:00 am, a weekly informal gathering to discuss current lab practices and potentially vote on new initiatives.
